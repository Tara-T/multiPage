        <p id="win-1">
          The original Windows 1 was released in November 1985 and was
          Microsoft’s first true attempt at a graphical user interface in
          16-bit. Development was spearheaded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates
          and ran on top of MS-DOS, which relied on command-line input. It was
          notable because it relied heavily on use of a mouse before the mouse
          was a common computer input device. To help users become familiar with
          this odd input system, Microsoft included a game, Reversi (visible in
          the screenshot) that relied on mouse control, not the keyboard, to get
          people used to moving the mouse around and clicking onscreen elements.

        <h3>Windows 2.0</h3>

        <p>
          Two years after the release of Windows 1, Microsoft’s Windows 2
          replaced it in December 1987. The big innovation for Windows 2 was
          that windows could overlap each other, and it also introduced the
          ability to minimise or maximise windows instead of “iconising” or
          “zooming”. The control panel, where various system settings and
          configuration options were collected together in one place, was
          introduced in Windows 2 and survives to this day. Microsoft Word and
          Excel also made their first appearances running on Windows 2.

        <h3>Windows 3</h3>

        <p>
          The first Windows that required a hard drive launched in 1990. Windows
          3 was the first version to see more widespread success and be
          considered a challenger to Apple’s Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga
          graphical user interfaces, coming pre-installed on computers from
          PC-compatible manufacturers including Zenith Data Systems. Windows 3
          introduced the ability to run MS-DOS programmes in windows, which
          brought multitasking to legacy programmes, and supported 256 colours
          bringing a more modern, colourful look to the interface. More
          important - at least to the sum total of human time wasted - it
          introduced the card-moving timesink (and mouse use trainer) Solitaire.

        <h3>Windows 95</h3>

        <p>
          As the name implies, Windows 95 arrived in August 1995 and with it brought the first ever Start button and Start menu (launched with a gigantic advertising campaign that used the Rolling Stones’ Start Me Up, and a couple of months later Friends stars Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry. Could it be any more up-to-date?)

          It also introduced the concept of “plug and play” – connect a peripheral and the operating system finds the appropriate drivers for it and makes it work. That was the idea; it didn’t always work in practice.
          
          Windows 95 also introduced a 32-bit environment, the task bar and focused on multitasking. MS-DOS still played an important role for Windows 95, which required it to run some programmes and elements.
          
          Internet Explorer also made its debut on Windows 95, but was not installed by default requiring the Windows 95 Plus! pack. Later revisions of Windows 95 included IE by default, as Netscape Navigator and NCSA Mosaic were popular at the time.

        <h3>Windows ME</h3>
        <p>
          Considered a low point in the Windows series by many – at least, until they saw Windows Vista – Windows Millennium Edition was the last Windows to be based on MS-DOS, and the last in the Windows 9x line.

          Released in September 2000, it was the consumer-aimed operating system twined with Windows 2000 aimed at the enterprise market. It introduced some important concepts to consumers, including more automated system recovery tools.
          
          IE 5.5, Windows Media Player 7 and Windows Movie Maker all made their appearance for the first time. Autocomplete also appeared in Windows Explorer, but the operating system was notorious for being buggy, failing to install properly and being generally poor.
